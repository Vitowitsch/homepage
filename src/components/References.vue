Veit is a quick learner with a good grasp of theory. Working with him is fun and efficient, and even long sessions were enjoyable. He is also a good companion to have during hikes in the Scottish Highlands, and he plays a pretty good game of blind chess. I can recommend him as a team player and as a very skilled software creator.''",
