      The estimated number of premature deaths due to traffic related air pollution is
      estimated by 60 thousand per year in Germany. Even if this number is controversial,
      65 German cities surpassed the pollution levels in 2017. If they all were fined by
      the EU, this would add up to millions of Euros. Traffic related pollution was one of
      the topics at the 2018â€™s

      - Hackathon at the ministry of environment.
      <p></p>
      It took place in the ministry itself that had been perfectly equipped with beds and
      all the stuff you need for a 24h hackathon. Even Minister Svenja Schulze herself
      showed up.
      <p></p>
      I was part of a team of seven. The idea for the final project only emerged the night
      before the hackathon: We built a smart system that calculates dynamic price for
      entering - or parking - in the city, based on the real time NOx level. It should
      also include a 24h hours forecast.
      <p>
        There were two options for billing: Either an IOT device on the car that would
        automatically deduct the payment from a prepaid account when it entered a city
        zone, or smart parking ticket vending machines.
      </p>
      Our hackathon IoT-prototype retrieves real time and forecast pollution data from our
      cloud service. The city toll is deducted from a prepaid account, based on GPS and
      NOx level. Users can see their account balance, a 24 hour pollution forecast with
      corresponding prices on their mobile phones.
      <p></p>
      We hope that this is a first step towards fewer cars and better air in cities. Cito
      can enforce legal pollution thresholds and bans on diesel cars - without tracking
      any personal GPS data.
      <p></p>
      Let us turn the grey sky blue again!
